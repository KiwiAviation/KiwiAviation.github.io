title: Carbon dioxide measurement station
---
August 2024

## At a glance
**What:** Designed and built a low-cost solar-powered device to measure carbon flux cycles.

**How:** Prototyped and refined electronic design through breadboard testing and final soldered assembly. Programmed ESP32 microcontroller firmware with MicroPython.

**Why:** Developed to be a low-cost open-source alternative to expensive commercial equipment used to measure carbon flux cycles in scientific research.

*Skills: electronic prototyping, soldering, Python*

## Resources
This project was inspired by a research paper titled, "". The paper (link) and accompanying source code (link) were extremely useful throughout the design. As of August 2024, the microcontroller/development board used in the Fluxbots (PyCom LoPy4) is no longer sold, which is what led me to adapt this project to utilize the ESP32.
