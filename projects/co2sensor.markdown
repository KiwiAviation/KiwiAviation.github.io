title: Carbon Dioxide Measurement Station
---
August 2024

## At a glance

*Skills: electronic prototyping, soldering, Python*

**What:** Designed and built a low-cost solar-powered device to measure carbon cycling.

**How:** Prototyped and refined electronic design through breadboard testing and final soldered assembly. Programmed ESP32 microcontroller firmware with MicroPython.

**Why:** Developed to be a low-cost open-source alternative to expensive commercial equipment used to measure carbon flux cycles in scientific research. Published project relied upon depreciated electronic components, prompting me to adapt the design.

## Resources
This project was closely inspired by the research paper, *"Fluxbots: A Method for Building, Deploying, Collecting and Analyzing Data From an Array of Inexpensive, Autonomous Soil Carbon Flux Chambers", Elizabeth Forbes et al. (June 2023)*. The paper and accompanying source code were extremely useful throughout the design.
