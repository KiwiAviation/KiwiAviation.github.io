title: Power Distribution Unit Firmware (Formula SAE Electric)
---

January 2025 - May 2025

## At a glance

_Skills: C, SPI, CAN bus, reading datasheets, SMT soldering_

**What:** Created firmware for the power distribution unit, a board that manages low voltage power on Olin College's Formula SAE Electric vehicle.

**How:** Developed C code from scratch to create hardware timers, send and receive CAN messages, read ADC inputs, control a 7-segment display, and interface with an IO expander via SPI.

**Why:** Enables team to instantly view vehicle status through visual indicators (LEDs and 7-segment display), allowing the team to identify and address issues faster.
