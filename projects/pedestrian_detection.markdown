title: Pedestrian detection using PCA
---
December 2024

## At a glance
**What:** Created a pedestrian detection algorithm using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

**How:** Implemented algorithm in MATLAB to determine whether a pedestrian was close by in an image with a 78% accuracy rate. Utilized PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the input images, increasing computational efficiency.

**Why:** Pedestrian detection for vehicle safety features must function in resource constrained systems, making efficient algorithms crucial.

*Skills: MATLAB, computer vision, principal component analysis*

For my final project in Quantitative Engineering Analysis 1 (Linear Algebra) I worked with a partner to create a pedestrian detection algorithm using principal component analysis (PCA).

Our algorithm, implemented in MATLAB, determined whether a pedestrian was close by in an image with a 78% accuracy rate. Our model was trained and tested on a subset of images from the Caltech pedestrian detection dataset.
